Beatstar mix
##description
Beatstar mix was totally inspired by beatstar, which is a music game where you can try and unlock musical beats, similar to bofHit. Beatstar mix is not a game, it is a utility or application where you can do with your packs. For example, among what stands out the most is the automatic detection and creation of the bpm, without the need to give spacebar every so often, something that has not been done yet. You can hear how the level is with the automatic synchronization before creating the bpm, music playback controls and actions, you can even create a random remix with the music and actions, creating different styles and rhythms but based on the pack you choose!
##notas:
This is still in development, you could make a beta version if you want to test, but keep in mind that the development versions sometimes tend to have errors.
Clarification: In some cases, it is normal that the playback of music and actions may be slowed down or delayed, this is due to the performance of your CPU and your machine. If you have a good CPU it shouldn't give you much trouble, but if you create a file with the bpm in a pack and play it with the beatstar, you will see that the levels will be in sync, as long as the loops are done correctly. I am seriously thinking these days to change the sleep function that fulfills the action of waiting for the correct time for the actions for another time function that does not pause the entire script if the delay is not generated only in the part where it is due.
###build
For this requires autoit (https://www.autoitscript.com/cgi-bin/getfile.pl?autoit3/autoit-v3-setup.exe)
Or for a better experience, download SciTE (https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit-script-editor/downloads/)
